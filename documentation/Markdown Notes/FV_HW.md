# Structure of hardware proofs

* Step 1: Describe the specification of the circuit to be verififed, and set the goal to be proved.


* Step 2: Expand the definitions of the specification and implementation, to obtain formulae at desired level of implementation
* Step 3: Simplify the goals into subgoals by applying induction rules and/or domain specific rules
